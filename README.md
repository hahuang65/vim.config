# vimrc

NOTE: I no longer use vanilla vim. I have a [neovim](https://github.com/hahuang65/nvim.config) config as well.

My personal configuration for vanilla [vim](https://www.vim.org/)
I will do my best to comment the configuration file. Feel free to crib/steal this for your own personal use.

## Usage

Run ./install.sh to link the configuration files to the proper location

[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is the plugin manager of choice, so see that repository for instructions on how to use it.
